## Motivation
Our motivation for creating this app is to develop a space where a variety of students, which includes foreign, transfer, and incoming freshman students, can connect with others, tackling the issue of an overwhelming lifestyle transition into university. Our app seeks to make connections less intimidating by providing organization as well as a separation between personal socialization and school persona. It serves to encourage students to connect with others so they don't have to put so much effort into searching for similar resources. As frightful as it is to step out of one’s comfort zone and introduce yourself to others, our app will prove to be a comfortable environment that will encourage socialization using an anonymity feature. Centered around group chats, a casual tone will create a sense of friendliness and keep our users comfortable.

## Goals
In order to connect different university students with each other, our app provides access to different University-related groups, activities, and individuals so that students have the ability to make this college lifestyle transition with ease. 

Ideally, our app will have an active user base with people in the University community being actively involved in the creation, management, and interaction of their individual groups and activities. The amount of users active on the app will hopefully reflect the increase of comfort and the decrease in intimidation of connecting within the student demographic.

We also would like to implement a feature that allows the students within a certain group or community to bond with other members of a shared grouping. On top of this, we would like to maintain user retention on the app by motivating them to keep logging on almost daily. Nothing builds comradery faster than having a shared goal. Each group chat will be able to take care and raise a plant into a tree by watering it every day. 

In future implementations of our application, we aim to obtain certain members of different groups that serve as potential “ambassadors” or “leaders” of their groups in order to help manage and encourage members of their communities to help. Having a leadership role also can help to moderate happenings within the group.

Hey! I am Kenji Sanehira and I am currently a Computer Science senior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I would like to apply my knowledge from school related to Computer Science into the workforce. I am also the stage manager for the international-tour of the musical "Peace on Your Wings". In my free time, I enjoy 3D printing, going to the gym, and playing video games. Learning about mobile application development for ConnectUni has been a really fun and educational experience that I hope to apply skills from in the future.

Aloha! I am Raphael, and I am a senior studying for my B.S. in Computer Science. I am an aspiring software engineer and desire to work as a backend developer. I enjoy surfing, rollerblading, and weightlifting on my free time. I consider myself to be a very social student which is what drives me to develop a mobile app that enables other students, especially students who are less social or students in a new environment, to connect with other students in similar classes or interests!
