# ConnectUni Project Usability Evaluation Design

## User Goals:
* User is able to connect with other students easily.
* User can interact and participate in different groups that fit their interest.
* User has an easier transition into the social aspect of a college lifestyle.

## Scenarios:
1. Finding a classmate: Pretend you are in a classroom and you want to add a classmate to your ConnectUni account so that you can study with them throughout the semester. Assuming they have a ConnectUni account, add them to be your friend and send them a quick message.
2. Join a classmate's group: Suppose you have a classmate that you've just met and became friends with. Go to their profile and see if there are any groups they are in that you'd be interested in. If there are, join them!
3. Connecting with a group: You really like playing chess and want to find others on campus also passionate about chess. Join a chess group and send a message introducing yourself.
4. Creating a group: You really enjoy underwater basket weaving (or something akin to this) and there are no current ConnectUni groups that fit this interest. Create it!
5. Finding an event on the calendar: You want to connect with others and want to see what are the upcoming events for the groups you're currently in. Find a future event you may want to attend. 

## User Types:
Important user types for ConnectUni include Incoming Freshmen, Transfer Students, and Seniors. While our app may help incoming freshmen and transfer students the most to connect with their peers, students with senior standing may provide helpful feedback as well due to having the experience to know what is needed for the app. Freshman and transfer students are able to provide vital information to our application as it aims to allow a smoother social transition for university students to branch out and "Connect(with the)Uni". Seniors have likely already been given time to connect with their peers socially in their 4 years at the University and are able to provide feedback now reflecting on whether this app would have been beneficial to their upbringing.

## Recruitment:
In our ConnectUni Dev group, we will each reach out to people that we know that may identify with our established user groups.
Within our dev group, we have direct connections to many seniors and freshmen at the University of Hawaii and various other Universities that we can ask to broaden the demographic of our study.

## Consent Form:
The consent form used can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14fPQbSwQmcPEIrkCradx6-3GMGyNlne2xGfgbVFbO58/edit?usp=sharing).

## Participant Recruitment:
Participants were recruited from the ICSpace room where Freshman and Transfer students were asked to evaluate the application. This enabled these students to be able to discuss with one another the concept of the mobile app and whether or not it would be beneficial to their social life.

## Usability Testing:

### Description of Participants:
* Participant A: Senior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. 
* Participant B: Freshman at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. 
* Participant C: Freshman at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. 
* Participant D: Freshman at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. 
* Participant E: Freshman at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. 
* Participant F: Transfer Freshman at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
* Participant G: Freshman at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. 
* Participant H: Freshman at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. When asked about how they feel on campus comfort-wise answered with "I feel its alright, a lot different than [the social environment] of high school".
* Participant I: Senior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Started attending during the COVID-19 pandemic when all classes were on zoom.
* Participant J: Freshman at Leeward Community College. Initially also started college during the pandemic but dropped out due to lack of social connections due to zoom-only classes.

### Time and Place:
* Testing session for Participant A were conducted at the ICSpace room in person at 2 pm on 12/04/23.
* Testing sessions for Participants B-G were conducted at the ITC building in person after 3 pm on 12/04/23.
* Testing session for Participant H was in-person at Hamilton Library at 12 pm on 12/05/2023.
* Testing session for Participant I was in-person at Hamilton Library at about 2 pm on 12/05/2023.
* Testing session for Participant J was in online over discord at around 8 pm on 12/05/2023.

### Script:
General Usability Testing Script for our Application:
* Hey [Tester], create a ConnectUni account and set it up with your information. The photos field isn't yet fully implemented, so you can put in whatever you want for that field.
* After that is done, try to fill your profile with things you are interested in.
* Suppose you changed your major, can you change this on your profile?
* Notice how you aren't in any groups yet. Look up a group you would like to join. If it doesn't exist, make it!
* Within the group, see if there are any people that interest you. If there are, send a friend request.
* Say you accidentally joined another group on accident. Leave that group if you don't want to be in it anymore.
* Let's say you're trying to search based on your interests. Go to the search tab and find someone based on "Computer Science".
* A group you just joined might not know about their newest member. Send an introductory message to the group chat.
* You notice a classmate from one class in a group that you are in! Send them a direct message saying that you have just created a ConnectUni account!
* Thank you so much for participating in our usability test. To close out, please fill out this google form and let us know what we can improve with our application!
