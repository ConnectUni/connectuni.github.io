# ConnectUni Project Usability Evaluation Design

## User Goals:
* Create profile
* Search for a friend
* Add your interests
* Join a Group
* Send a message
* Add a friend
* Join an Event

## Scenarios:
1. Create your profile: Your professor just made an announcement about a great new app called ConnectUni. Create an account and set up your complete profile (including interests) on the app.
2. Finding a classmate: Pretend you are in a classroom and you want to add a classmate to your ConnectUni account so that you can study with them throughout the semester. Assuming they have a ConnectUni account, add them to be your friend and send them a quick message.
3. Connecting with a group: You really like playing chess and want to find others on campus also passionate about chess. Join a chess group and send a message introducing yourself. 
4. Creating a group: You find out that there is no group on ConnectUni for ICS 446. Make a group for ICS 446.
5. Creating an event: You just created a group chat for ICS 446 and want to orchestrate a study session. Create an event in your ICS 446 group thatâ€™ll be held one week from now.
6. Join an Event: Suppose you are extremely bored and want to connect with people in your groups. Check the events calendar to see if there are any events that fit your schedule that your groups are hosting.


## User Types:
Important user types for ConnectUni include Incoming Freshmen, Transfer Students and Seniors. While our app may help incoming freshmen and transfer students the most to connect with their peers, students senior standing may provide helpful feedback as well due to having the experience to know what is needed for the app. Freshman and transfer students are able to provide vital information to our application as it aims to allow a smoother social transition for University students to branch out and "Connect(with the)Uni". Seniors have likely already been given time to connect with their peers socially in their 4 years at the University and are able to provide feedback now reflecting on if this app would be beneficial to their upbringing.

## Recruitment:
In our ConnectUni Dev group, we will each reach out to people that we know that may identify with our established user groups. Each dev will be responsible for finding users.
Within our dev group we have direct connections to many seniors and freshman at the University of Hawaii and various other Universities that we can ask to broaden the demographic of our study.
