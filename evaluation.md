# ConnectUni Project Usability Evaluation Design

## User Goals:
* User is able to connect with other students easily.
* User can interact and participate in different groups that fit their interest.
* User has an easier transition into the social aspect of a college lifestyle.

## Scenarios:
1. Finding a classmate: Pretend you are in a classroom and you want to add a classmate to your ConnectUni account so that you can study with them throughout the semester. Assuming they have a ConnectUni account, add them to be your friend and send them a quick message.
2. Join a classmate's group: Suppose you have a classmate that you've just met and became friends with. Go to their profile and see if there are any groups they are in that you'd be interested in. If there are, join them!
3. Connecting with a group: You really like playing chess and want to find others on campus also passionate about chess. Join a chess group and send a message introducing yourself.
4. Creating a group: You really enjoy underwater basket weaving (or something akin to this) and there are no current ConnectUni groups that fit this interest. Create it!
5. Finding an event on the calendar: You want to connect with others and want to see what are the upcoming events for the groups you're currently in. Find a future event you may want to attend. 

## User Types:
Important user types for ConnectUni include Incoming Freshmen, Transfer Students, and Seniors. While our app may help incoming freshmen and transfer students the most to connect with their peers, students with senior standing may provide helpful feedback as well due to having the experience to know what is needed for the app. Freshman and transfer students are able to provide vital information to our application as it aims to allow a smoother social transition for university students to branch out and "Connect(with the)Uni". Seniors have likely already been given time to connect with their peers socially in their 4 years at the University and are able to provide feedback now reflecting on whether this app would have been beneficial to their upbringing.

## Recruitment:
In our ConnectUni Dev group, we will each reach out to people that we know that may identify with our established user groups.
Within our dev group, we have direct connections to many seniors and freshmen at the University of Hawaii and various other Universities that we can ask to broaden the demographic of our study.

## Consent Form:
The consent form used: [ConnectUni Testers Consent Form](ConnectUni Testers Consent Form.docx)

## Participant Recruitment:
Participants were recruited from the ICSpace room where Freshman and Transfer students were asked to evaluate the application. This enabled these students to be able to discuss with one another the concept of the mobile app and whether or not it would be beneficial to their social life.

## Usability Testing:

### Time and Place:
Testing session for Participant 1 were conducted at the ICSpace room in person at 2 pm on 12/04/23.
Testing sessions for Participants 2-6 were conducted at the ITC building in person after 3 pm on 12/04/23.

### Script:
General Usability Testing Script for our Application:
* Hey [Tester], create your account.


### Raw Data:
The application was tested on a team member's laptop where participants would need to perform their testing through the emulator from IntelliJ.
#### Participant 2: 
##### Scenario 1. 
Clicked on the ICS 466 group>Clicked on the top right "info" button>Clicked on another user's profile>Clicked the "Connect with me!" button
##### Scenario 2.
Stayed on the same other user's profile>Scrolled down the page>Clicked on one of the "Join" buttons of the groups
##### Scenario 3.
Clicked the top left back arrow button until back at the "Groups" page>Clicked on the "Search" icon on the footer>Clicked on "Filter">Asked, "Where's chess?">Used the search bar and typed in "chess">Saw "Add a group" and clicked that button>Created a chess group>Clicked on the group and sent "hi"
##### Scenario 4. 
Clicked on the top left back arrow>Clicked on the "Search" icon on the footer>Clicked on the "Add a group" button>Created a group
##### Scenario 5.
Clicked on the "Calendar" icon on the footer>Clicked on a date with a dot on the day

## Results:
