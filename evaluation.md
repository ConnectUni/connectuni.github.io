# ConnectUni Project Usability Evaluation Design

## User Goals:
* Create profile
* Add your interests
* Join a Group
* Send a message
* Add a friend
* Join an Event

## Scenarios:
1. Finding a classmate: Pretend you are in a classroom and you want to add a classmate to your ConnectUni account so that you can study with them throughout the semester. Assuming they have a ConnectUni account, add them to be your friend and send them a quick message.
2. Connecting with a group: You really like playing chess and want to find others on campus also passionate about chess. Join a chess group and send a message introducing yourself. 

## User Types:
Important user types for ConnectUni include Incoming Freshmen, Transfer Students and Seniors. While our app may help incoming freshmen and transfer students the most to connect with their peers, students senior standing may provide helpful feedback as well due to having the experience to know what is needed for the app.

## Recruitment:
In our ConnectUni Dev group, we will each reach out to people that we know that may identify with our established user groups. Each dev will be responsible for finding users.
Within our dev group we have direct connections to many seniors and freshman at the University of Hawaii and various other Universities that we can ask to broaden the demographic of our study.
